# README

So, i worked with Atemy as support to finish the project after i submitted it. I remidied the problems that i posted in the submission ticket. But we can still talk about them. I also learned that i messed up with my spec files and should have had index, new, show, edit or update, delete or destroy. for some reason i didnt get that i needed to have the specific actions in specific spec files. I think i need some clarity on this when looking at the stories to understand where the story should actually go
